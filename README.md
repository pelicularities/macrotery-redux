# Macrotery Redux

[Macrotery](https://github.com/pelicularities/macrotery) is a Progressive Web App (PWA) that originated as a final project from [Le Wagon's](https://github.com/lewagon) Full-Stack Web Development bootcamp (batch #454, Singapore). It is a restaurant reservation/ordering/delivery app that allows users to search for meals based on their macronutrient breakdowns.

In this Macrotery Redux repo, I'm continuing to work on the project to finish and refine features that were left incomplete at the end of the bootcamp.
